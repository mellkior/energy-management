# **Personal Enery Management**
## **Controlling your energy balance**
- *balance like accounting not balance like yoga*
- *energy like calories not energy like yoga*

Note: While this guide is mainly for people who are losing weight, most of it applies to people who are gaining weight too â€” almost everyone has the same goals: low body fat and high muscle mass.


>Bodies aquire energy through the consumption of food, and expend energy to maintain homeostasis and perform useful actions like thinking and running. Energy consumed in excess of the body's expended energy is stored for later use. Most people want to prevent a buildup of excess body fat and to do so you have to control your daily energy balance. 

1. To gain weight: **end each day with a positive net energy balance**
    - *eat more calories than you use*
2. To maintain weight: **end each day with a zero net energy balance**
    - *eat as many calories as you use*
3. To lose weight: **end each day with a negative net energy balance**
    - *eat fewer calories than you use*

> With that in mind, here is how I control my energy balance.

# **Track your energy consumption**
> If you aren't tracking what you eat there is zero chance you are in control of your daily energy balance. You can track with pen and paper but an app is much easier.

> There are many apps designed for just this purpose, and many are free. [Samsung Health](https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/samsung-health/) is my favorite because it's free, easy to use, has a fantastic food database and if you have a samsung phone, it's already installed. 

> Some apps (including [Samsung Health](https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/samsung-health/)) can also track your activity to get a more accurate picture of your daily energy balance, but it's really only key to track the food you eat. You can estimate your average daily nutritional needs based on your age, sex, height, weight and activity level, and a good food tracking app will do this for you. If you track your calorie intake for a week and you aren't seeing the expected result in your body, then you may need to adjust your estimated daily calorie needs as each individual is different.

## Tracking your food has 3 main benefits:
### 1. **You know how much to eat in order to gain, maintain or lose weight**.
> If you aren't tracking, how do you know how much to eat? If eating whatever, whenever you feel like works for you, why are you reading this? 

>The common recommendation for losing weight is to end each day with an energy deficit of 500 to 1000 calories, so for someone with a total average daily calorie requirement of 2500, you might aim to eat 1500 to 2000, depending on how quickly you want to lose weight, and how uncomfortable you're willing to be. 

>Assuming most of the weight you lose is body fat, you can do a rough calculation of how much weight you are losing based on your energy deficit. Fat has approximately 9 calories per gram and there are about 453 grams in a pound, so there are 4000 calories in a pound of fat, more or less. If your energy deficit is 1000 calories a day, you should lose a pound of body fat every 4 days, or almost 2 pounds a week.
### 2. **It adds limbic friction, or difficulty, to the act of eating.**
 > This may not be beneficial if you're gaining weight, but if you're losing weight it will make eating because you're bored or want to do something fun and easy less fun and less easy. Once you know how much to eat (see 1. above) the challenge for most people is not eating too much, which this added friction discourages.
### 3. **It allows you to strategize**
> You know how much to eat each day to reach your goals (see 1. above). You have added some friction to every eating event to make them deliberate and hopefully more discerning. Now you can employ additional strategies to achieve what everyone wants: low body fat, high muscle mass. No one wants to lose muscle mass, and many people want to gain it. Recommendations differ, but eating a lot of protein is generally thought to help maintain and build muscle. I aim for 0.7 to 1.0 grams of protein per pound of body weight. Note that I use my goal weight for this calculation. You can also determine what foods make you feel full (for me foods high in protein and fat) and avoid foods that make you feel hungry (for basically everyone this is sweets and refined carbohydrates) in order to prevent overeating.

## Additional benefits
> You may gain insight into your eating habits as you track your food and find for example that your intake is unevenly distributed across the day. If you're starving yourself in the morning and eating a huge amount in the evening you may want to balance it out to feel fuller throughout the day. You might also get something out of tracking your daily activity, heart rate, glasses of water, etc. that many health apps allow you to do.

# **Exercise every day**
Yes, some muscle groups could use a rest day and yes, sometimes you may be sick or injured, and yes, you should exercise every single day. 
> **There is always some part of your body you can excercise.**

## Exercising every day has 3 main benefits:
### 1. **You don't have to make a decision**.
> Making desisions uses up limited top-down control. Eliminate the question "Should I exercise today?" by making the answer "Yes!" every time. Instead of deciding if you should you will think about what muscle groups need a rest and what you can work on or if you'd rather go on a run or a long walk today.
### 2. **It builds muscle**
> Gains. We all want them. It feels good in the short term (chemicals, chemicals!) and in the long term (enjoy your achievements) to increase strength, speed, endurance, muscle mass, whatever it is you're working on. And if you're losing weight, you want to make sure your body is breaking down fat and not muscle. Eat plenty of protein and use all of your muscles regularly to remind your body, "I need those!", so it will break down fat instead.
### 3. **It increases your daily calorie use**
> Obviously. That means you'll have the option to lose weight faster, or to eat more each day while still losing weight. Exercise also builds muscle, or so I'm told, and being metabolically hungry, more muscle will increase your daily calorie use.

# **Floss and brush your teeth early**
Because you're tracking your food, you will plan on fitting your daily calories into the meals you expect to have. If you love eating late at night an plan on it, maybe that can work for you but in general, if you floss and brush your teeth after the last planned meal of the day, it locks in the calories you've eaten for the day. Another benefit is you'll be ready for bed and you won't have to floss when you're tired.
